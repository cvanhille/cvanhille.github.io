                An expert in modelling complex systems, I am a trained physicist with a deep passion for understanding the fundamental principles that drive both biological systems and societal phenomena. 
                My work integrates physics-based modelling, advanced data analysis, and computational techniques to uncover hidden patterns and mechanisms, predict emergent behaviours, and provide actionable insights. 
                With experience spanning theoretical biophysics, statistical modelling, and policy evaluation, I am committed to applying rigorous scientific methods to tackle pressing real-world challenges, 
                from cellular dynamics to large-scale social systems.

                My research focuses on modelling cell motility, intracellular self-organisation, and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, using theoretical and computational approaches to uncover the fundamental principles 
                governing biological systems. During my PhD, I developed models to investigate cytoskeletal self-assembly, membrane reshaping, and vesicle dynamics, shedding light on the physical mechanisms underlying 
                cellular processes. By combining statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics, and large-scale simulations, I explored how molecular interactions drive emergent behaviour in living systems.

            <p>
                Beyond biophysics, I have applied my expertise in computational modelling to societal challenges, particularly in the areas of refugee dynamics, public health, and infectious disease transmission. 
                At Brunel University, I worked on agent-based models of refugee movement in response to conflict, incorporating food security dynamics and collaborating with international organisations to translate 
                scientific insights into policy recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as a Senior Infectious Disease Modeller at UKHSA, I focus on developing and applying mathematical and computational models to inform public health policy. My work involves analysing disease transmission 
                patterns, evaluating intervention strategies, and providing data-driven insights to support evidence-based decision-making in disease prevention and control. By integrating epidemiological data, stochastic 
                modelling, and computational simulations, I aim to improve our understanding of infectious disease spread and contribute to the design of effective mitigation strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My broader research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical physics, complex systems, and policy-driven modelling, with the goal of leveraging quantitative approaches to address both fundamental 
                and applied problems in biology and society.
