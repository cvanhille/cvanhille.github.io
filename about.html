                An expert in modelling complex systems, I am a trained physicist with a deep passion for understanding the fundamental principles that drive both biological systems and societal phenomena. 
                My work integrates physics-based modelling, advanced data analysis, and computational techniques to uncover hidden patterns and mechanisms, predict emergent behaviours, and provide actionable insights. 
                With experience spanning theoretical biophysics, statistical modelling, and policy evaluation, I am committed to applying rigorous scientific methods to tackle pressing real-world challenges, 
                from cellular dynamics to large-scale social systems.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            I am a physicist specialising in computational modelling of complex systems, with expertise spanning biological systems, statistical physics, and societal dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
            My academic journey includes a PhD in Computational and Theoretical Biophysics from University College London, supervised by Prof. Anđela Šarić. 
            My research focused on developing models to investigate the physical mechanisms underlying molecular organisation in biological processes, 
            particularly in cytoskeletal self-assembly and membrane reshaping. During my doctoral studies, I worked as a visiting scientist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), 
            collaborating closely with experimentalists and contributing to high-impact publications in journals such as Nature, Nature Physics, and PNAS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Master’s degree in the Physics of Complex Systems from Université Paris Diderot, where I specialised in stochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics, and biophysics. 
            My interdisciplinary background laid the foundation for applying physics-based modelling to a wide range of complex systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond biophysics, I have applied my expertise in computational modelling and data analysis to broader societal challenges. Under the supervision of Prof. Derek Groen at Brunel University, I worked on 
            agent-based models of refugee movement, incorporating food security dynamics and collaborating with international organisations to translate scientific insights into actionable policy recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work is driven by a commitment to using rigorous scientific methods to address real-world problems, whether in the realm of biological self-organisation or complex societal systems. 
            With a strong foundation in computational techniques, large-scale simulations, and interdisciplinary research, I aim to bridge the gap between fundamental science and its practical applications, 
            leveraging modelling and data science to generate meaningful insights.
