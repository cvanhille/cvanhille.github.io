                My research focuses on modelling cell motility, intracellular self-organisation, and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, using theoretical and computational approaches to uncover the fundamental principles 
                governing biological systems. During my PhD, I developed models to investigate cytoskeletal self-assembly, membrane reshaping, and vesicle dynamics, shedding light on the physical mechanisms underlying 
                cellular processes. By combining statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics, and large-scale simulations, I explored how molecular interactions drive emergent behaviour in living systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond biophysics, I have applied my expertise in computational modelling to societal challenges, particularly in the areas of refugee dynamics, public health, and infectious disease transmission. 
                At Brunel University, I worked on agent-based models of refugee movement in response to conflict, incorporating food security dynamics and collaborating with international organisations to translate 
                scientific insights into policy recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as a Senior Infectious Disease Modeller at UKHSA, I focus on developing and applying mathematical and computational models to inform public health policy. My work involves analysing disease transmission 
                patterns, evaluating intervention strategies, and providing data-driven insights to support evidence-based decision-making in disease prevention and control. By integrating epidemiological data, stochastic 
                modelling, and computational simulations, I aim to improve our understanding of infectious disease spread and contribute to the design of effective mitigation strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My broader research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical physics, complex systems, and policy-driven modelling, with the goal of leveraging quantitative approaches to address both fundamental 
                and applied problems in biology and society.

            <p><b>Out-of-Equilibrium Molecular Self-Organisation in the Cell</b></p>
            <p>
                Cells are constantly reshaping and reorganising themselves through energy-driven processes. My research focuses on how molecular assemblies, such as cytoskeletal filaments and protein networks, 
                spontaneously emerge and adapt to changing conditions. Using computational models, I have explored how dynamic filament structures contribute to bacterial cell division and how synthetic molecular 
                systems can be designed to mimic biological self-organisation. These studies help uncover the fundamental principles that govern cell architecture and function.

            <p><b>Biological Membrane Mechanics and Deformation Processes</b></p>
            <p>
                Cellular membranes continuously reshape to support essential functions such as trafficking, division, and repair. My research explores how proteins and cytoskeletal structures influence membrane 
                deformation, including the formation of tubular structures and the stabilisation of damaged organelles. Understanding these processes provides key insights into how cells maintain their integrity 
                and interact with their environment.

            <p><b>Agent-Based Simulations of Migration Dynamics</b></p>
            <p>
                Human migration is shaped by a complex interplay of individual decisions, environmental constraints, and broader socio-political forces. I have developed agent-based models that incorporate factors 
                such as food security to simulate refugee movements in response to conflict. These models provide insights into large-scale migration patterns and can inform policy decisions on resource allocation, 
                humanitarian aid, and crisis response.

            <p><b>Infectious Disease Modelling for Policy</b></p>
            <p>
                Mathematical and computational models are essential tools for understanding disease spread and guiding public health interventions. My work focuses on integrating real-world data with predictive models 
                to assess the impact of different policies and intervention strategies. By combining agent-based approaches, network models, and statistical methods, I aim to develop frameworks that support evidence-based 
                decision-making in public health.

            <p><b>Collective Motion in Self-Propelled Matter</b></p>
            <p>
                Many biological and synthetic systems exhibit collective motion, where individual units—such as cells, bacteria, or active particles—move in coordinated ways without central control. My research investigates 
                how simple local interactions give rise to large-scale patterns, using computational models to explore the effects of confinement, external forces, and energy input. These studies help us understand a wide 
                range of phenomena, from bacterial swarming to the behaviour of active materials.
